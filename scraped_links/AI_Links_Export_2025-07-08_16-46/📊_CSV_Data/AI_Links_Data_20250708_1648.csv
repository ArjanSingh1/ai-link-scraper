The next wave of AI progress will hinge less on stacking parameters and more on exploration, the process of acquiring new and informative experience. To talk about experience collection, we must also ask what it costs to collect them. Scaling is, in the end, a question of resources – compute cycles, synthetic‑data generation, data curation pipelines, human oversight, any expenditure that creates learning signal. For simplicity, I’ll fold all of these costs into a single bookkeeping unit I call flops. Strictly speaking, a flop is one floating‑point operation, but the term has become a lingua franca for “how much effort did this system consume?” I’m co‑opting it here not for its engineering precision but because it gives us a common abstract currency. My discussion depends only on relative spend, not on the particular mix of silicon, data, or human time. Treat flops as shorthand for “whatever scarce resource constrains scale.”

Pretraining is exploration

Pretraining is exploration The standard LLM pipeline is to first pretrain a large model on next-token prediction with a large amount of text and then finetune the model with RL to achieve some desired objectives. Without large-scale pretraining, the RL step would struggle to make any progress. This contrast suggests that pretraining has accomplished something that is difficult for tabula rasa RL (i.e., from scratch).

A seemingly contradictory and widely observed trend in recent research is that smaller models can demonstrate significantly improved reasoning abilities once distilled using the chain-of-thought generated by larger, more capable models. Some interpret this as evidence that large scale is not a prerequisite for effective reasoning. In my opinion, this conclusion is misguided. The question we should ask is: if model capacity is not the bottleneck for reasoning, why do small models need to distill from a larger model at all?

The question we should ask is: if model capacity is not the bottleneck for reasoning, why do small models need to distill from a larger model at all? A compelling explanation for both observations is that the immense cost of pretraining is effectively paying a massive, upfront “exploration tax.” By themselves, models with no pretraining or smaller pretrained models have a much harder time reliably exploring the solution space and discovering good solutions on their own1. The pretraining stage pays this tax by spending vast amounts of compute on diverse data to learn a rich sampling distribution under which the correct continuations are likely. Distillation, in turn, is a mechanism for letting a smaller model inherit that payment, bootstrapping its exploration capabilities from the massive investment made in the larger model.

Why is this pre-paid exploration so important? In its most general form, the RL loop looks something like this:

Exploration. The agent generates some randomized exploration trajectories. • Reinforce. The good trajectories are up-weighted and the bad ones are down-weighted. Reinforce. The good trajectories are up-weighted and the bad ones are down-weighted. For this learning loop to be effective, the agent must be capable of generating at least a minimal number of “good” trajectories during its exploration phase. This concept is sometimes called coverage in RL. In LLMs, this exploration is typically achieved through sampling from the model’s autoregressive output distribution. Under this exploration scheme, the correct solutions need to already be likely in the naive sampling distribution. If a lower‑capacity model rarely stumbles on a valid solution by random sampling, it would have nothing useful to reinforce.

If a lower‑capacity model rarely stumbles on a valid solution by random sampling, it would have nothing useful to reinforce. Exploration without any prior information is a very difficult process. Even in the simplest tabular RL setting, where every situation (a state) and every action can be listed out in a table, theory says learning needs a lot of trials. A well known lower-bound on the sample complexity on the number of episodes for tabular RL is \(\Omega(\frac{SAH^2}{\epsilon^2})\) (Dann & Brunskill, 2015), where \(S\) is the size of the state space, \(A\) is the size of the action space, \(H\) is the horizon, and \(\epsilon\) is the “distance” to the best possible solution. This means that the minimum number of episodes grows linearly with the number of state-action pairs, and quadratically with the horizon. For LLMs, the state space now includes every possible text prefix, and the action space is any next token, both of which are very large. Without any prior information, RL in this setting would be practically impossible. Exploration without any prior information is a very difficult process.

Up to now, the hard work of exploration has been largely done by pretraining and learning a better prior from which to sample trajectories. However, this also means that the types of trajectories the model can sample naively are heavily constrained by the prior. To progress further, we must figure out how to move beyond the prior.

Exploration helps generalization

Exploration helps generalization Historically, RL research has focused on solving a single environment at a time, like Atari or MuJoCo. This is equivalent to training and testing on the same datapoint. However, how well a given model does in the single environment does not say much about how well the model can handle truly novel situations. Machine learning is ultimately about generalization: for many hard problems, if we know them in advance, we can engineer a bespoke solution. What matters is succeeding on problems we haven’t seen or even anticipated. Historically, RL research has focused on solving a single environment at a time, like Atari or MuJoCo.

What matters is succeeding on problems we haven’t seen or even anticipated. The generalization performance of RL is critical for language models. During training, an LLM sees only a finite set of prompts, yet at deployment it must handle arbitrary user queries that could be very different from the ones seen during training. Notably, current LLMs excel at tasks with a verifiable reward (e.g., coding puzzles or formal proofs) because the correctness can be easily checked. The tougher question is to generalize these capabilities to fuzzier domains (e.g., generate a research report or write a novel) where feedback is sparse or ambiguous, and large-scale training and data collection are difficult.

What are some options we have for training a generalizable model? A recurring theme of deep learning is that data diversity drives robust generalization. Exploration directly controls the diversity of the data. In supervised learning, a labeled example reveals all its details in a single forward pass2 so the only way to increase data diversity is to collect more data. In RL, by contrast, each interaction only exposes a narrow slice of the environment. As a result, the agent must gather a sufficiently varied set of trajectories to build a representative picture. If the trajectories collected lack diversity (e.g., naive random sampling), the policy can overfit to that narrow slice and stumble even within the very same environment.

If the trajectories collected lack diversity (e.g., naive random sampling), the policy can overfit to that narrow slice and stumble even within the very same environment. This problem compounds when there are multiple environments. A popular RL generalization benchmark is Procgen, which is a collection of Atari-like games that have procedurally generated environments, so each game in principle contains “infinitely” many environments. The objective is to train on a fixed number of environments for a fixed number of steps and generalize to completely unseen environments3. This problem compounds when there are multiple environments.

The objective is to train on a fixed number of environments for a fixed number of steps and generalize to completely unseen environments Many existing approaches for this benchmark treat the problem as a representation learning problem and apply regularization techniques adapted from supervised learning (e.g., dropout or data augmentation). These help, but they overlook exploration, one of the most important structural components of RL. Since the agents collect their own data, they can improve generalization by changing exploration. In a previous work, my coauthors and I showed that pairing an existing RL algorithm with a stronger exploration strategy can double its generalization performance on Procgen without explicit regularization. In a more recent work, we found that better exploration also lets the model leverage more expressive model architectures and computational resources, and generalize better on Procgen as the result4.

The way we do exploration with LLMs today is fairly simple, typically limited to sampling from the model’s autoregressive distribution with tweaks to temperature or entropy bonus, so there is a large design space for potentially better exploration approaches. Admittedly, there have not been many successful examples in this direction. This could be because it is a very hard problem, it is not flop-efficient enough to be practical, or we just haven’t tried hard enough. However, if Procgen-style exploration gains do translate, we’re leaving efficiency – and perhaps entirely new capabilities – on the table. The next section discusses where we might look first.

Two axes of scaling exploration

Two axes of scaling exploration Exploration, in the broad sense I’m using here, is deciding what data the learner will see. That decision happens on two distinct axes:

Exploration, in the broad sense I’m using here, is deciding what data the learner will see. That decision happens on two distinct axes: • World sampling – deciding where to learn. World here refers to a particular problem that needs to be solved. In supervised learning (or unsupervised pretraining), this axis covers data collection, synthetic generation and curation: gathering and filtering raw documents, images, or code, each of which corresponds to a “world”. In RL, this corresponds to designing or generating environments, such as a single math puzzle or a coding problem. We can even arrange the worlds into curricula. In both cases, world sampling is fundamentally about what “data points” the learner is allowed to see. This also decides the limit on all the information any agent can possibly learn.

In both cases, world sampling is fundamentally about what “data points” the learner is allowed to see. This also decides the limit on all the information any agent can possibly learn. • Path sampling – deciding how to gather data inside a world. This step is unique to RL. Once a world is chosen, the agent still has to pick which trajectories to collect: random walks, curiosity‑driven policies, tree search, tool-use, etc. Different path‑sampling strategies can have different computation cost and produce very different training distributions even when the underlying world is identical. In short, path sampling is about what the learner “wants” to see. Path sampling – deciding how to gather data inside a world. This step is unique to RL. Once a world is chosen, the agent still has to pick which trajectories to collect: random walks, curiosity‑driven policies, tree search, tool-use, etc. Different path‑sampling strategies can have different computation cost and produce very different training distributions even when the underlying world is identical. In short, path sampling is about what the learner “wants” to see. In supervised learning or unsupervised pretraining, the second axis incurs a constant cost because a single forward (and backward) pass has access to all the information each data point contains (e.g., cross-entropy loss). Because there is no obvious way to “dig deeper” inside a single example (other than make the models larger), the exploration cost lives almost entirely on the first axis – world sampling. The flops can either go into acquire new worlds (e.g., new data points) or processing existing worlds (e.g., curation and synthetic data).

The flops can either go into acquire new worlds (e.g., new data points) or processing existing worlds (e.g., curation and synthetic data). In contrast, RL has much more flexibility in the second axis (in addition to the first axis). Because most random trajectories reveal little information about the ideal behavior, the information density (useful bits per flop) in RL is far lower than in supervised learning or pretraining. If we naïvely sample trajectory, we risk wasting flops on noise. So it’s imporant to be judicious about how we spend our flops5. There are also more options for spending flops to explore within each world. For example, we can either sample more trajectories from a single environment or we can spend more flops thinking about how to sample the next trajectory to discover high-value states and actions.

There are also more options for spending flops to explore within each world. For example, we can either sample more trajectories from a single environment or we can spend more flops thinking about how to sample the next trajectory to discover high-value states and actions. For most, if not all, machine learning problems, the high-level goal can be understood as maximizing information per flop. For that purpose, these two levers form a trade-off curve. If one spends too much resources on world sampling and not enough on path sampling, the agent may not extract any meaningful experience from the sampled worlds. Vice versa, if one spends too much resources on a small set of worlds, the agent could overfit to the training worlds and would not learn generalizable behavior that transfer across worlds. The ideal scenario happens somewhere in between where the resources are divided between sampling new worlds and running algorithms (i.e., better than random sampling) that can extract more information from a single world.

If you are familiar with scaling laws, what I just described sounds a lot like the Chinchilla scaling laws but the two axes correspond to the compute used for different types of sampling rather than parameters and data. At each performance level, one should to be able to trace out an isoperformance curve where the x-axis and y-axis are the compute put into interacting with any given environment and the compute given to the environments, whether it is for generating the environment or for running the environment (e.g., a generative verifier with CoT).

Of the two axes, path sampling is a relatively well-defined problem. A principled approach for doing exploration within an environment is to reduce the model’s uncertainty6. Many existing approaches for exploration have very strong sample complexity but they tend to be prohibitively expensive. Nonetheless, there is arguably a well-defined objective for path sampling and the main obstacle is to figure out a computationally efficient approximation. On the other hand, it is much less clear what the objective is for world sampling. One appealing idea is open-ended learning but even open-ended learning requires defining the universe of all environments (i.e., environment specs) or a subjective observer that judges whether an outcome is “interesting”.

What objective should world sampling optimize? The unfortunate reality (or fortunate, depending on your perspective) is that the space of environments is infinite, but our resources are finite. If we want to do something useful, then we must express some preference over the environments. I suspect that the problem of designing environments will eventually become similar to selecting pretraining data. It will be hard to say exactly why one environment will help another environment and we will need a lot of them. In other words, there may not be a single clean and nice objective for designing environment specs. What objective should world sampling optimize?

The more likely scenario (probably already happening) is that everyone will start designing specs within their own expertise or domain of interest. When we have enough “human-approved” and “useful” specs, maybe we can try to learn some common principles and eventually automate the process by learning from them, much like how pretraining data is selected today. It would be inconvenient if we need the same amount of environments as pretraining data to achieve the same level of generality for decision making, but there are some preliminary evidence that this may not be the case. In a recent work, we found that a fairly small number of environments is enough to train an agent capable of general exploration and decision making in entirely out-of-distribution environments. Furthermore, using existing LLMs could also greatly accelerate the design process.

Of course, these are all very high-level musings and how one exactly scales these two axes is much less obvious than scaling pretraining. However, if we were able to figure out a reliable way to introduce scale into world sampling, and a more intelligent way of path sampling, we should be able to see isoperformance curves that bends inwards towards the origin (maybe they won’t be as smooth). This style of scaling laws would teach us the best way to allocate computation resource between the environments and the agent.

Final thoughts I could keep unfolding more tangents – better curiosity objectives, open-endedness, meta‑exploration that learns how to explore – but I think it is more important to make the high-level point clear. I could keep unfolding more tangents – better curiosity objectives open-endedness meta‑exploration that learns how to explore – but I think it is more important to make the high-level point clear. Existing paradigms of scaling have been incredibly effective but all paradigms will eventually saturate. The question is where to pour the next orders of magnitude of compute. I’ve argued that exploration – both world sampling and path sampling – offers a promising direction. We don’t yet know the right scaling laws, the right environment generators, or the right exploration objectives, but intuitively they should be possible. The coming years will decide whether exploration can stretch our flops further on top of the existing paradigms. I think the bet is worth making.

I think that says much more about the environments than the exploration method itself. • There is a wide family of RL algorithms under the names of posterior sampling or information-directed sampling that try to direct the exploration to reduce the model’s uncertainty, but they are generally too expensive to be done exactly at the scale of LLMs. Various approximations exist but they have not been widely used for LLMs to the best of my knowledge. ︎

- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**
  - Result from three decades of freely accessible human text online.
  - Ilya Sutskever compares this information reservoir to **fossil fuel**: abundant but finite.
  - Studies indicate that frontier labs may exhaust high-quality English web text before the decade ends.
  - Current models consume data faster than humans can produce it.

- **Era of Experience**
  - Coined by David Silver and Richard Sutton.
  - Progress relies on data generated by learning agents themselves.
  - The bottleneck is not just any experience, but the **right kind of experience** that benefits learning.
  - Future AI advancements will focus on **exploration** rather than merely stacking parameters.

- **Cost of Experience Collection**
  - Scaling involves resource considerations:
    - Compute cycles
    - Synthetic data generation
    - Data curation pipelines
    - Human oversight
    - Any expenditure that creates learning signals.
  - Introduced a bookkeeping unit called **flops**:
    - Represents one floating-point operation.
    - Used as a common currency for measuring effort consumed by systems.
    - Discussion focuses on relative spending, not specific resources.

- **Exploration in Data-Driven Systems**
  - Exploration is crucial for all data-driven systems to decide which experiences to collect.
  - Broader definition of exploration beyond reinforcement learning (RL).
  - Inspired by Minqi’s article: **General intelligence requires rethinking exploration**.

- **Post Organization**
  - The following sections will cover:
    1. How pre-training solved part of the exploration problem.
    2. Why better exploration leads to better generalization.
    3. Recommendations for resource allocation over the next hundred thousand GPU-years.

- **Pretraining as Exploration**
  - Standard LLM pipeline:
    1. Pretrain a large model on next-token prediction using extensive text.
    2. Fine-tune the model with RL for specific objectives.
  - Without pretraining, RL struggles to progress.
  - Smaller models can show improved reasoning when distilled from larger models, suggesting:
    - Large scale is not a prerequisite for effective reasoning.
    - However, the need for distillation raises questions about model capacity.
  - **Exploration Tax**:
    - Pretraining incurs a significant upfront cost for exploration.
    - Models without pretraining find it harder to explore the solution space effectively.
    - Pretraining invests in diverse data to learn a rich sampling distribution.
    - Distillation allows smaller models to inherit exploration capabilities from larger models.

## The Era of Exploration

### Importance of Pre-Paid Exploration
- **Pretrained models** vs. smaller models:
  - Smaller models struggle to explore the solution space effectively.
  - Pretraining involves significant compute resources to learn a rich sampling distribution.
- **Distillation**:
  - Allows smaller models to inherit the exploration capabilities of larger models.
  - Bootstraps exploration from the investment made in larger models.

### Reinforcement Learning (RL) Loop
- General structure of the RL loop:
  - **Exploration**: Agent generates randomized exploration trajectories.
  - **Reinforce**: Good trajectories are up-weighted; bad ones are down-weighted.
- **Coverage in RL**:
  - Essential for the agent to generate a minimal number of “good” trajectories during exploration.
  - In LLMs, exploration is achieved through sampling from the model’s autoregressive output distribution.
  - Correct solutions must be likely in the naive sampling distribution.
  - Lower-capacity models may struggle to find valid solutions through random sampling.

### Challenges of Exploration
- Exploration without prior information is difficult:
  - In tabular RL, learning requires numerous trials.
  - Sample complexity lower-bound: \(\Omega(\frac{SAH^2}{\epsilon^2})\) (Dann & Brunskill, 2015)
    - **Variables**:
      - \(S\): Size of the state space
      - \(A\): Size of the action space
      - \(H\): Horizon
      - \(\epsilon\): Distance to the best solution
  - Minimum episodes grow linearly with state-action pairs and quadratically with the horizon.
- For LLMs:
  - State space includes every possible text prefix.
  - Action space is any next token, both very large.
  - Without prior information, RL becomes nearly impossible.

### Role of Pretraining
- Pretraining has facilitated exploration by learning a better prior for sampling trajectories.
- However, this constrains the types of trajectories that can be sampled naively.
- Future progress requires moving beyond the prior.

### Exploration and Generalization
- Historical focus of RL research:
  - Solving single environments (e.g., Atari, MuJoCo).
  - Equivalent to training and testing on the same data point.
- Generalization in machine learning:
  - Success on unseen or unanticipated problems is crucial.
- Importance for LLMs:
  - During training, LLMs see a limited set of prompts.
  - At deployment, they must handle arbitrary user queries.
- Current LLM performance:
  - Excels in tasks with verifiable rewards (e.g., coding puzzles, formal proofs).
  - Challenges arise in fuzzier domains (e.g., generating reports, writing novels) where feedback is sparse.

### Options for Training Generalizable Models
- Data diversity is key for robust generalization:
  - Exploration directly influences data diversity.
- In supervised learning:
  - A labeled example reveals all details in one forward pass.
  - Increasing data diversity requires collecting more data.
- In RL:
  - Each interaction exposes a narrow slice of the environment.
  - Agents must gather varied trajectories to build a representative picture.
  - Lack of diversity in collected trajectories can lead to overfitting.

## The Era of Exploration

### Supervised Learning vs. Reinforcement Learning (RL)
- **Supervised Learning**: 
  - Labeled examples reveal all details in a single forward pass.
  - Data diversity can only be increased by collecting more data.

- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: 
  - Each interaction exposes a narrow slice of the environment.
  - Agents must gather varied trajectories to build a representative picture.
  - Lack of diversity in trajectories (e.g., naive random sampling) can lead to overfitting.

### Challenges in Multiple Environments
- **Procgen Benchmark**: 
  - A collection of Atari-like games with procedurally generated environments.
  - Each game theoretically contains “infinitely” many environments.
  - Objective: Train on a fixed number of environments and generalize to unseen ones.

### Existing Approaches and Limitations
- Many approaches treat the problem as a **representation learning** issue.
- Regularization techniques adapted from supervised learning (e.g., dropout, data augmentation) are commonly used.
- These techniques help but often overlook **exploration**, a crucial component of RL.

### Importance of Exploration
- Agents can improve generalization by modifying exploration strategies.
- Previous research demonstrated that pairing RL algorithms with stronger exploration strategies can:
  - Double generalization performance on Procgen without explicit regularization.
  - Allow models to leverage more expressive architectures and computational resources.

### Comparison with LLMs
- While Procgen is less complex than problems faced by **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, the problem structure is similar:
  - RL agents are trained on a finite set of problems and tested on new problems without further training.
- Current exploration methods for LLMs are simplistic, often limited to:
  - Sampling from the model’s autoregressive distribution.
  - Tweaks to temperature or entropy bonus.
- There is significant potential for better exploration approaches.

### Challenges in Exploration for LLMs
- Few successful examples of improved exploration strategies exist due to:
  - Difficulty of the problem.
  - Inefficiency in terms of computational resources.
  - Lack of rigorous attempts to explore this area.
- If Procgen-style exploration gains can be translated to LLMs, there may be:
  - Increased efficiency.
  - New capabilities.

## Two Axes of Scaling Exploration
- **Exploration**: Deciding what data the learner will see occurs on two axes:
  1. **World Sampling**:
     - Refers to deciding where to learn (specific problems to solve).
     - In supervised learning, this includes data collection, synthetic generation, and curation.
     - In RL, it involves designing or generating environments (e.g., math puzzles, coding problems).
     - World sampling determines the data points the learner can access and limits the information any agent can learn.
  2. **Path Sampling**:
     - Unique to RL; involves deciding how to gather data within a chosen world.
     - Agents select trajectories to collect (e.g., random walks, curiosity-driven policies, tree search, tool-use).
     - Different path-sampling strategies incur varying computational costs and produce different training distributions.

### Cost Considerations
- In supervised learning or unsupervised pretraining:
  - The second axis incurs a constant cost due to access to all information in each data point during a single forward and backward pass.
- In RL, exploration costs primarily reside on the first axis (world sampling):
  - Computational resources can be allocated to acquiring new worlds or processing existing ones.

## The Era of Exploration

### Key Concepts
- **Supervised Learning** and **Unsupervised Pretraining**:
  - Constant cost on the second axis due to access to all information in data points.
  - Exploration cost primarily on the first axis – **world sampling**.

- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**:
  - Greater flexibility on both axes (world sampling and path sampling).
  - Random trajectories often reveal little about ideal behavior, leading to lower information density (useful bits per flop).
  - Naïve trajectory sampling risks wasting flops on noise.

### Spending Flops Wisely
- Options for exploring within each world:
  - Sample more trajectories from a single environment.
  - Invest flops in strategizing the next trajectory to discover high-value states and actions.

### Trade-off Curve
- High-level goal in machine learning: **Maximize information per flop**.
- Trade-off between:
  - **World Sampling**: Too much focus may lead to meaningless experiences.
  - **Path Sampling**: Overfitting to a small set of worlds can hinder generalization.
- Ideal scenario: Balanced resource allocation between sampling new worlds and extracting information from existing ones.

### Scaling Laws
- Similar to **Chinchilla scaling laws**:
  - Two axes correspond to compute used for different types of sampling rather than parameters and data.
  - Isoperformance curve traces compute for interacting with environments and compute for generating/running environments.

### Path Sampling vs. World Sampling
- **Path Sampling**:
  - Well-defined problem with a clear objective: reduce model uncertainty.
  - Existing approaches have strong sample complexity but can be expensive.

- **World Sampling**:
  - Less clear objectives; open-ended learning requires defining environment specifications.
  - Infinite space of environments vs. finite resources necessitates preference expression over environments.

### Designing Environments
- Challenge: Designing environments may resemble selecting pretraining data.
- No single objective for environment specs; likely to be domain-specific.
- Potential for automation in environment design through learning from human-approved specs.
- Preliminary evidence suggests fewer environments may suffice for generality in decision-making.

## The Era of Exploration

- **Objective**: Train an agent for general exploration and decision-making in out-of-distribution environments.

- **Design Process Acceleration**: 
  - Utilizing existing **Large Language Models (LLMs)** can significantly speed up the design process.
  - Anticipated trend: Individuals will design specifications within their own areas of expertise.

- **Learning from Specifications**: 
  - Accumulating enough ""human-approved"" and ""useful"" specifications may allow for the identification of common principles.
  - Potential to automate the design process, similar to current pretraining data selection.

- **Generalization Concerns**: 
  - It would be inconvenient if the same number of environments as pretraining data is needed for decision-making generality.
  - Preliminary evidence suggests that a small number of environments can suffice for training agents in out-of-distribution settings.

- **Scaling Challenges**: 
  - Scaling exploration and decision-making is less straightforward than scaling pretraining.
  - Reliable methods for world sampling and intelligent path sampling are needed.
  - Expected outcome: Isoperformance curves that bend inwards towards the origin, indicating efficient resource allocation between environments and agents.

## Final Thoughts

- **Exploration Focus**: 
  - Exploration (world sampling and path sampling) is a promising direction for future research.
  - Current scaling paradigms have been effective but will eventually reach saturation.
  - The challenge lies in determining where to allocate additional computational resources.

- **Future Considerations**: 
  - Unknowns include the right scaling laws, environment generators, and exploration objectives.
  - The next few years will reveal if exploration can enhance computational efficiency beyond existing paradigms.

## Key Points

- **RL Optimization Objective**: 
  - A valid alternative possibility is that the RL optimization objective may not perform well with smaller models, but this is likely not the case as successful RL applications have historically involved small models.

- **Information Availability**: 
  - Models may not fully exploit available information due to computational limitations, but the information remains accessible if desired.

- **Generalization Assumption**: 
  - For generalization to be feasible, it is assumed that a ""good enough"" policy exists for all environments, akin to the assumption of minimal label noise in supervised learning.

- **Performance Benchmark**: 
  - At the time of writing, a new state-of-the-art performance was achieved on the ""25M easy"" benchmark of ProcGen.

- **Random Sampling Effectiveness**: 
  - Random sampling works reasonably well for many problems, such as Atari, indicating more about the environments than the exploration method.

- **Exploration Algorithms**: 
  - A variety of RL algorithms, including posterior sampling and information-directed sampling, aim to reduce model uncertainty during exploration but are often too costly for LLMs at scale.
  - Various approximations exist but have not been widely adopted for LLMs.",0.3358102766798419

Coupled-GRPO In diffusion LLMs, the per-timestep loss $\mathcal{L}_{t}$ typically computes log-probabilities only at masked token positions, which leads to inefficiency and high variance when sampling is limited. To address this, Coupled-GRPO introduces a coupled-sampling scheme:

In diffusion LLMs, the per-timestep loss $\mathcal{L}_{t}$ typically computes log-probabilities only at masked token positions, which leads to inefficiency and high variance when sampling is limited. To address this, Coupled-GRPO introduces a coupled-sampling scheme: • For each training example, we select $\lambda$ pairs of timesteps $(t, \hat{t})$ such that $t + \hat{t} = T$.

Training on Verifiable Rewards RL environments allow for rewarding outcomes and intermediate steps in an evaluation. Models take many attempts at a problem, using test-time compute to ""think"" before it answers. Human created autograders reward the attempts which were ""good"". Reinforcing on those ""good"" trajectories upweights the chains of thought that were used to get to the answer. This teaches models to think correctly about different types of problems as researchers iteratively hill climb evals. These environments can be thought of as existing on a spectrum of rigidity between two categories:

This is where RL has achieved early massive success already, notably, AlphaProof, AlphaFold, and DeepSeek R1 and the many code generation models on the market today. Subjective domains: It’s more difficult to measure accuracy in many real world tasks such as generating investment memos, making legal briefs, providing therapy.

Computer-use agents sit somewhere in the middle. For most of the tasks humans do on computers, goals start to become ambiguous and multi-faceted. Once defined, the actions and outcomes are programmatic and verifiable. These could include planning trips, responding to emails, shopping, or posting on social media. In all of these cases, containerized environments allow for horizontal scaling to learn online from thousands of interactions in parallel. Computer-use agents sit somewhere in the middle.

The Path Forward Meeting today’s data demand requires rethinking the way we generate signal from human efforts. Creating evals and RL environments is the highest leverage and most durable use of people’s time.

As AI enters the workforce and operates over proprietary information and under unique professional contexts, these environments codify knowledge and goals for agents. Once individual steps of agentic workflows reach sufficient reliability, all that will be left will be RL training on the goals laid out by humankind.

This week on Unsupervised Learning, Patrick Chase and I sat down with Brendan Foody, the co-founder and CEO of Mercor, a company building AI-native labor markets. They’re operating at the intersection of AI x recruiting, data labeling, evals and more and recently raised $100M at a $2B valuation. What you’ll take away:

- Why most humans will soon be doing evals as their job
- How AI is already outperforming humans in hiring assessments
- Why legacy data labeling pipelines are breaking down
- How Mercor uses AI to make its own hiring more predictive
- How a meeting with xAI revealed a massive market shift for Mercor

Listen here👇

Spotify: https://bit.ly/4jSyG2R
Apple: https://bit.ly/4mHAiz3

Some other key take-aways:

📈 Most Knowledge Work Will Become Evaluation Work

Brendan believes a massive shift is underway: instead of doing tasks, many knowledge workers will soon focus on creating evaluations that teach models how to do those tasks. As foundation models automate more work, it becomes economically and structurally more efficient for humans to build evals than to execute the work themselves. Brendan sees this as not just a niche market, but one of the core directions the labor economy is heading toward.

🧠 AI Already Outperforms Humans at Candidate Assessment

Mercor has found that models are now better than most humans at interpreting resumes, assessing interviews, and predicting job performance. They’ve even replaced parts of their internal hiring funnel with AI interviewers—and seen conversion rates improve. The most valuable part of human input in hiring is now shifting toward selling the opportunity, not evaluating the candidate.

️ Crowdsourced Labeling Pipelines Are Breaking Down

As model quality improves, the old approach of using lightly trained gig workers to produce training data no longer works. Today’s models require high-context, edge-case data—created in tight collaboration with researchers. Brendan explains how Mercor capitalized on this shift by focusing on rapidly sourcing highly skilled contributors, not just volume.

YouTube: https://lnkd.in/gFBfd_6f Spotify: https://bit.ly/4jSyG2R Apple: https://bit.ly/4mHAiz3 Some other key take-aways:

📈 Most Knowledge Work Will Become Evaluation Work

Brendan believes a massive shift is underway: instead of doing tasks, many knowledge workers will soon focus on creating evaluations that teach models how to do those tasks. As foundation models automate more work, it becomes economically and structurally more efficient for humans to build evals than to execute the work themselves. Brendan sees this as not just a niche market, but one of the core directions the labor economy is heading toward.

🧠 AI Already Outperforms Humans at Candidate Assessment

Mercor has found that models are now better than most humans at interpreting resumes, assessing interviews, and predicting job performance. They’ve even replaced parts of their internal hiring funnel with AI interviewers—and seen conversion rates improve. The most valuable part of human input in hiring is now shifting toward selling the opportunity, not evaluating the candidate.

️ Crowdsourced Labeling Pipelines Are Breaking Down

As model quality improves, the old approach of using lightly trained gig workers to produce training data no longer works. Today’s models require high-context, edge-case data—created in tight collaboration with researchers. Brendan explains how Mercor capitalized on this shift by focusing on rapidly sourcing highly skilled contributors, not just volume.

Applications for the Mercor Graduate Fellowship close at the end of the day this Thursday, May 15. Apply before the deadline—and refer your friends! Mercor works with thousands of PhDs and postdocs across fields—from math to philosophy. We see firsthand that academia is full of people whose talents are wildly under-funded and under-valued. We’d like to change that—beginning with this fellowship. MERITOCRACY

We want to identify exceptional talent regardless of academic pedigree, institutional affiliation, or personal connections. Traditional fellowship programs rely heavily on recommendation letters, publication records, and prestigious affiliations—metrics that frequently favor those with established networks and privileged backgrounds. All we want to evaluate is to understand (i) what problems you are trying to solve and (ii) how you want to solve them. This allows us to discover brilliant talent who might be overlooked by conventional selection processes—whether you're from a top-ranked university or a less-known institution, whether you have impressive publications or are still developing your research. The Mercor Graduate Fellowship is designed to support talented individuals who demonstrate exceptional promise but may lack resources or recognition. We want to increase access to opportunity and funding in academia. THE FELLOWSHIP

- $50,000, no strings attached.
- Open to current PhD students and postdocs in STEM fields.
- To apply, just upload a resume and take a 10-minute virtual interview with Mercor’s AI
- Apply by May 15th (but we review applications as they come in)

THE NETWORK

We’ll host a retreat for selected fellows to connect with other people building cool things and thinking deep thoughts. THE BONUS

Searching for talent is hard—refer someone who wins, and we’ll pay you $10,000. Brendan Foody

The Grammarly Gambit: An Empire in Two Moves While the market obsessed over chatbot demos and press releases, Grammarly executed a two-step strategic coup to build the world’s first true agentic productivity platform.

In late 2024, Grammarly acquired Coda. They didn’t buy a popular doc app. They bought the operating system for their future AI agents. This was the foundational act of war. As undeniable proof, Coda founder Shishir Mehrotra wasn’t just given a board seat; he was installed as Grammarly’s new CEO. He isn’t running a company; he is performing a hostile takeover of its DNA, injecting Coda’s agentic framework into a platform with 40 million daily active users.

Months later, Grammarly acquired Superhuman. This was not about adding a slick email client. Superhuman is what Mehrotra calls the “perfect staging ground for orchestrating multiple AI agents simultaneously.” Email is the chaotic nexus where work, communication, and tasks collide. Grammarly didn’t buy Superhuman for its pathetic summarization features; they bought the most valuable turf in professional life to serve as the GUI for their Coda-powered agentic backend. Imagine it: A sales agent, a support agent, and a scheduling agent collaborating within a single email draft, orchestrated by the Coda engine, pulling live context from connected Packs, executing tasks across a dozen SaaS apps. That is the gambit. Move 2 (Conquer the Battlefield): Seize the Critical Interface

The reason I’m not yet bullish on Coda’s future is due to one key problem that LLMs still don’t solve particularly well: data collection. Specifically, I’ve been thinking a lot about the following limitations of Coda, as I understand its vision going forward: • Collecting data by typing into Coda’s quadrangle notes (cells) is too slow and impractical. Instead, data should come from voice/video meetings and recordings, mobile/desktop screen activity, linked/shared content sources, mobile phone conversations, and visual/audible/touch perception input devices. Pushing data from hardware devices in real time becomes even more critical than pulling it from structured database, because if data isn’t captured quickly enough, the use of the database can become unreliable and irrelevant even within a minute.

Just so you know, I don’t have access to any internal “cookbook” or strategic plans. These are simply my best guesses and interpretations based on what’s publicly available and general market trends. Regarding your first question about data collection, there are already many AI-powered tools out there that are really good at capturing voice from meetings, whether you’re in the room or online. These tools can pull out and organize key information, remarks, and action items from conversations. When we think about the “surfaces” and “orchestration” Grammarly is building, meeting platforms are a big communication area. It makes sense that Grammarly might look to acquire a company in this field. They’d likely be looking for strong AI features, existing connections to other tools, potential for their “agents” to expand, and solid support for many languages. Companies like Sembly AI, Fireflies.ai, Otter.ai, or MeetGeek come to mind.

While other ways of communicating have certainly grown, email is still a core, if not the core, communication hub for many businesses. That’s actually why Grammarly bought Superhuman. It’s not just about email itself; it’s also about the related areas Superhuman is working on, like chats, calendars, and tasks (direct overlap with Coda).

To your point: Packs, as currently conceived, remain constrained by several limitations I’ve outlined over time—chief among them, their closed nature and limited support for dynamic integration patterns.

Your AI Stack is a Museum Piece

Key points:

• Your AI Stack is a Museum Piece The chasm between the dying paradigm and the emerging one is not an increment; it is a cliff.

• One is a toy, the other is a weapon.

• One talks, the other acts.

• The stack Grammarly is building does not compete with the old one.

• It renders it irrelevant.

• The chasm between the dying paradigm and the emerging one is not an increment; it is a cliff.

One is a toy, the other is a weapon. One talks, the other acts. The stack Grammarly is building does not compete with the old one. It renders it irrelevant. The Moat Isn’t the Model; It’s the Machine

Key points:

• The Moat Isn’t the Model; It’s the Machine The winners of the AI war will not be the companies with the largest language model.

• That is a commodity race to the bottom.

• They will be the ones who own the orchestration framework that makes those models act.

• Building a better chatbot today is like perfecting the horse-drawn carriage in the age of the automobile.

• The real innovation was the assembly line and the highway system.

• The only defensible moat is the machine: the framework that enables action, the integrations that give it reach, the structured data that serves as its memory, and the user workflows that become its territory.

• The reason I’m not yet bullish on Coda’s future is due to one key problem that LLMs still don’t solve particularly well: data collection.

• Specifically, I’ve been thinking a lot about the following limitations of Coda, as I understand its vision going forward: • Collecting data by typing into Coda’s quadrangle notes (cells) is too slow and impractical.

• Instead, data should come from voice/video meetings and recordings, mobile/desktop screen activity, linked/shared content sources, mobile phone conversations, and visual/audible/touch perception input devices.

• Pushing data from hardware devices in real time becomes even more critical than pulling it from structured database, because if data isn’t captured quickly enough, the use of the database can become unreliable and irrelevant even within a minute.

As someone who has long supported email, it’s hard for me to admit this, but emails are now like the written contracts of a previous era. Today, very little needs to be formally written when people prefer adaptable, relevant content in audio/video formats. Email is no longer a practical communication channel - it belongs to the past.

In an era of LLMs—where tokenization of language is foundational to progress—this is concerning. Many LLMs still perform poorly in languages other than English. What does it mean to build a great app for the UK but a terrible one for France, simply because UX in the UK relies on quick chat-based communication, while in France it might depend on elaborate instructions—or worse, traditional filters and search?

Regarding your first question about data collection, there are already many AI-powered tools out there that are really good at capturing voice from meetings, whether you’re in the room or online. These tools can pull out and organize key information, remarks, and action items from conversations. When we think about the “surfaces” and “orchestration” Grammarly is building, meeting platforms are a big communication area. It makes sense that Grammarly might look to acquire a company in this field. They’d likely be looking for strong AI features, existing connections to other tools, potential for their “agents” to expand, and solid support for many languages. Companies like Sembly AI, Fireflies.ai, Otter.ai, or MeetGeek come to mind.

While other ways of communicating have certainly grown, email is still a core, if not the core, communication hub for many businesses. That’s actually why Grammarly bought Superhuman. It’s not just about email itself; it’s also about the related areas Superhuman is working on, like chats, calendars, and tasks (direct overlap with Coda). The whole idea is that all these interactions can be managed and brought together within Coda, building out an AI-powered productivity system that covers all the main places where work happens.

This feature allows for easy translation of messages, which is super important for international teams and global operations. This capability directly tackles language barriers in a crucial communication space, showing that Grammarly is focused on making its AI tools truly effective for a wide range of users worldwide.

It captures everything, and I can use it as a long-term memory or a funnel into Coda and other tools. Capturing contexts is probably where Grammarly is heading. For approximately 2.4 billion people, it remains practical in most cases. It’s not going anywhere, at least not in your lifetime. If you see ‘email’ when you see Superhuman, you need to recalibrate. The AI engine in this tool was perfected in one of the harshest environments, but it is applicable in many operational domains. They didn’t buy Superhuman to support email better.

Nina, thank you for the thoughtful words and for engaging so directly with these architectural questions. To your point: Packs, as currently conceived, remain constrained by several limitations I’ve outlined over time—chief among them, their closed nature and limited support for dynamic integration patterns. These constraints have historically hampered Coda’s ability to serve as a true orchestration hub, especially when it comes to handling real-world, real-time data flows.

These constraints have historically hampered Coda’s ability to serve as a true orchestration hub, especially when it comes to handling real-world, real-time data flows. However, with Grammarly’s expanding reach across critical “surfaces”—and their likely trajectory toward integrating voice, vision, and other modalities—there’s a strong possibility that Packs will evolve. In this emerging context, Packs could become the ideal conduit for retrieving context-rich, multimodal data from the broader Grammarly ecosystem. Rather than being a bottleneck, Packs may soon serve as the connective tissue between Coda’s orchestration framework and the vast, real-time data streams generated by Grammarly’s “mothership.”
